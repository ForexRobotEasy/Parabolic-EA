## Includes
The code includes the following libraries:
- MovingAverages.mqh
- RSI.mqh

## Global Variables
The code defines the following global variables:
- marketHigh: stores the highest price in the market
- marketLow: stores the lowest price in the market
- maValue: stores the value of the Moving Averages indicator
- rsiValue: stores the value of the RSI indicator

## Custom Indicator
The custom indicator section is responsible for initializing the Moving Averages and RSI indicators. If the initialization fails, an error message is displayed.

## Custom Trend Analysis
The AnalyzeTrend() function is called in the OnTick() function to implement an advanced algorithm for trend analysis. It identifies the market highs and lows by storing the current highest and lowest prices.

## Custom Trend Synchronization
The SynchronizeWithMovingAverages() function is called in the OnTick() function to get the value of the Moving Averages indicator and store it in the maValue variable.

## Custom Noise Filtering
The FilterMarketNoise() function is called in the OnTick() function to synchronize with the RSI indicator and store its value in the rsiValue variable. It then applies a noise filtering algorithm using the RSI indicator.

## Entry Point
The OnTick() function is the main entry point of the code. It executes the following steps:
1. Analyze the trend by calling the AnalyzeTrend() function.
2. Synchronize with the Moving Averages indicator by calling the SynchronizeWithMovingAverages() function.
3. Filter market noise by calling the FilterMarketNoise() function.
4. Execute the trading strategy based on the trend analysis and filtering.
